This version works only for OpenFOAM-1.5-dev.
Additional information to the DiplomarbeitFranzBlaim.pdf file, 
the described cyclic ggi implementation was just a simple cyclic ggi implementation. 
Therefore it was not committed, because the cyclicGGI which is under development by 
Martin Beaudon is much more versatile.
The same is true for the phaselagged boundary condition it was not added to the repository, 
because it has not shown a success. 
If somebody is interested in the source code of the phase lagged boundary condition just send a 
email to: franz[dot]blaim[at]gmx[dot]de
