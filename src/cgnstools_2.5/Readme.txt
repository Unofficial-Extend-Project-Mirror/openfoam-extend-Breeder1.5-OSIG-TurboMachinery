The optional package cgnstools is not compiled be default, but you can get 
a copy of the archive here, along with a Allwmake file for compiling it.

The cgnstools package can also be dowloaded from the following URL:
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=74444

We recommend that you download and install the version of cgnstools that match
the version of cgnslib used for libcgnsoo.

See the Allwmake file for the compilation recipe.
Adjust as you see fit for your local installation.
