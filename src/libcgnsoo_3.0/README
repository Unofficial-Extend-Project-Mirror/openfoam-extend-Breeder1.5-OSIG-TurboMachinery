This is the CGNSOO library. 
It aims at providing an object-oriented interface to the CGNS Mid-level library
suitable for integration with C++ development.

The CGNS Mid-level library is a C library to read and write CFD related data in
a CGNS file. A CGNS file is a binary archive with a hierarchical structure as 
defined by normative documents which can be found at http://www.cgns.org.

Since this structure and the MLL are still under development, the approach taken
is to simply wrap the MLL with a set of simple classes. These classes generally
don't store the actual CFD data; they only keep note of the handle (a path) into
the CGNS database. Because of this design, some of CGNS's idiosyncracies are
still apparent in CGNSOO. Errors are usually detected at the MLL level, but
checked by CGNSOO which throws a corresponding exception. The basic idea behind
this design was to minimize the amount of code to write and to keep it simple so
it can easily be adapted to follow the MLL evolution. For a different design
approach, see CGNS++ by Manuel Kessler at IAG in Stuttgart.

Some caveat:
The current version of CGNSOO was tested with MLL version 2.4.5
Testing was limited to 32-bits linux systems
Installation will likely require you to modify the Makefile
Support of CGNS database in MODIFY mode was barely tested.
