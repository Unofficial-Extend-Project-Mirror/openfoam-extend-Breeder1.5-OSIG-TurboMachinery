Do automatic post-processing by doing the following:
(this example uses time step 5000. To use another time step
modify the -time for sample, and modify in compareAll.gplt)

sample -case ../Case2 -time 5000
gnuplot compareAll.gplt
mozilla file://$PWD/compareAll.html

To plot the residuals do the following:
(This example assumes that you have a log file in your case directory)
foamLog ../.. Case2 ../log
gnuplot plotResiduals.gplt
mozilla file://$PWD/residuals.png
